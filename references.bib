     seek new two-dimensional (2D) materials with Dirac cones. Although 2D Dirac materials possess
     many novel properties and physics, they are rare compared with the numerous 2D materials. To
     provide explanation for the rarity of 2D Dirac materials as well as clues in searching for new
     Dirac systems, here we review the recent theoretical aspects of various 2D Dirac materials,
     including graphene, silicene, germanene, graphynes, several boron and carbon sheets,
     transition-metal oxides
       (VO2)n/(TiO2)m and
      (CrO2)n/(TiO2)m,
     organic and organometallic crystals, so-MoS2, and artificial lattices (electron
     gases and ultracold atoms). Their structural and electronic properties are summarized. We also
     investigate how Dirac points emerge, move, and merge in these systems. The von Neumann–Wigner
     theorem is used to explain the scarcity of Dirac cones in 2D systems, which leads to rigorous
     requirements on the symmetry, parameters, Fermi level, and band overlap of materials to achieve
     Dirac cones. Connections between existence of Dirac cones and the structural features are also
     discussed.}",

abstract={The semiconductor industry has been able to improve the performance of electronic systems for more than four decades by making ever-smaller devices. However, this approach will soon encounter both scientific and technical limits, which is why the industry is exploring a number of alternative device technologies. Here we review the progress that has been made with carbon nanotubes and, more recently, graphene layers and nanoribbons. Field-effect transistors based on semiconductor nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons have already been demonstrated, and metallic nanotubes could be used as high-performance interconnects. Moreover, owing to the excellent optical properties of nanotubes it could be possible to make both electronic and optoelectronic devices from the same material.},

abstract = {Abstract Graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice, offers a number of fundamentally superior qualities that make it a promising material for a wide range of applications, particularly in electronic devices. Its unique form factor and exceptional physical properties have the potential to enable an entirely new generation of technologies beyond the limits of conventional materials. The extraordinarily high carrier mobility and saturation velocity can enable a fast switching speed for radio-frequency analog circuits. Unadulterated graphene is a semi-metal, incapable of a true off-state, which typically precludes its applications in digital logic electronics without bandgap engineering. The versatility of graphene-based devices goes beyond conventional transistor circuits and includes flexible and transparent electronics, optoelectronics, sensors, electromechanical systems, and energy technologies. Many challenges remain before this relatively new material becomes commercially viable, but laboratory prototypes have already shown the numerous advantages and novel functionality that graphene provides.},

abstract={The stability of two-dimensional (2D) layers and membranes is the subject of a long-standing theoretical debate. According to the so-called Mermin{\^a}{\texteuro}``Wagner theorem1, long-wavelength fluctuations destroy the long-range order of 2D crystals. Similarly, 2D membranes embedded in a 3D space have a tendency to be crumpled2. These fluctuations can, however, be suppressed by anharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes meaning that a 2D membrane can exist but will exhibit strong height fluctuations2,3,4. The discovery of graphene, the first truly 2D crystal5,6, and the recent experimental observation of ripples in suspended graphene7 make these issues especially important. Besides the academic interest, understanding the mechanisms of the stability of graphene is crucial for understanding electronic transport in this material that is attracting so much interest owing to its unusual Dirac spectrum and electronic properties8,9,10,11. We address the nature of these height fluctuations by means of atomistic Monte Carlo simulations based on a very accurate many-body interatomic potential for carbon12. We find that ripples spontaneously appear owing to thermal fluctuations with a size distribution peaked around 80{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttenthousand}{\~A}{\ldots} which is compatible with experimental findings7 (50{\^a}{\texteuro}``100{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttenthousand}{\~A}{\ldots}). This unexpected result might be due to the multiplicity of chemical bonding in carbon.},
